Then it tries to find a positive number x such that when x is appended to the end of the string, the SHA256 hash of this new string is less than the target.

OUTPUT:

enter : iitk
The string hash value is :     6289398295137869117
The new string hash value is : 5192755073941371099
the new string is :iitk1
